# Sanity Demo

This is an example project we use to demonstrate how you can use the Sanity platform.

You can bootstrap a new project from this template by following this link to [sanity.io/create](https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io%2Fsanity-template-kitchen-sink).

## What you have

This is a demo example of a customized Sanity Studio. It is indented to be a sort of kitchen sink, a grab bag of many different examples and usages. All of them might not even necessarily make sense to have in a single Sanity Studio, but showing off different concepts and customizations is the goal here. Expect this template to expand and change a lot.

Some concepts covered in this template are

- Create landing pages and do page building on them for a web frontend
- A simple blog with web preview right in the Studio
- Custom embedded objects in rich text for Instagram posts, social media videos, LaTeX math etc.
- Simple example of Google Optimize A/B test facility

- A blazing frontend of landing pages and a blog with [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org)
- Structured content using [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io)
- Global deployment on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

## Quick start

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install` in the project root folder on local
3. `npm run dev` to start the studio and frontend locally
   - Your studio should be running on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)
   - Your frontend should be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
4. `npm run build` to build to production locally

## Enable real-time content preview on development

1. Go to your [project’s API settings on manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io/projects/5rrfu6ix/settings/api) and create a token with read rights.
2. Rename `.env.development.template` to `.env.development` and paste in the token: `SANITY_READ_TOKEN="yourTokenHere"`.
3. Restart the development server (`ctrl + C` and `npm run dev`).

If you want to turn off preview you can set `watchMode: false` in gatsby-config.js. If you just want to preview published changes you can set `overlayDrafts: false` in gatsby-config.js.

## Enable real-time preview outside of development

In order to have live previewing available outside of the `npm run dev` cycle you will have to set it up yourself.

The easiest way would be to utilize [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/sites/create). This will give you a deployment of the Gatsby web app set up to provide the same live preview as you have locally. A guide for setting this up can be found at https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/sanity/getting-started/. Note that this is a paid service from Gatsby.

For the 'Web preview' tabs in the Studio editors to work with a remote live preview instance, please remember to update the `baseUrl` value in `studio/resolvePreviewUrl.js`.

Should you want to host Gatsby in live preview yourself we have also included a Dockerfile and (.dockerignore) as a starting point in the web/ folder. Deploying that container is outside the scope of this example. There are many guides online on how to do that.

## Deploy changes

Netlify automatically deploys new changes commited to master on GitHub. If you want to change deployment branch, do so in [build & deploy settings on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#branches-deploys).
